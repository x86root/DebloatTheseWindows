# DebloatTheseWindows
Removes basic apps that are installed by default with Windows. Created with modularity in mind for the user to be able to customize however it best fits them. Future ideas are to implement a way to force the script to be run as admin, create an easier launch, and eventually add a GUI. README has more details, more updates/info to come!
